# Python decision making is done by using a conditional statement like the If statement
# An If statement consists of 3 parts -->
# If keyword
# a conditional operator
# the values which needs comparison

# An If condition always returns a True or a False

# Let's Dive into some Action now-->

# Let's find if alex is a Vampire ? ? -->

# Age of Alex-->

age = 100

if age >= 0 or age <= 99:
    print("Alex is a human")
else:
    print("OMG !!!! Alex is a Vampire")


# Let's put more conditions to our code to be sure that Alex is really a Vampire

if age >= 0 and age <=99:
    print("Alex is a human")
elif age <= 101:
    print("Alex might be a long lived human")
else:
    print("OMG!!! Alex is really a Vampire")

# Let's run the code now to see if Alex is a Vampire
